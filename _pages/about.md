# **About Me**

I am a **graduate student** supervised by [**Dr. Wenyao Xu**](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~wenyaoxu/) in the [**Embedded Sensing and Computing (ESC) Lab**](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~wenyaoxu/esc.html) at the **University at Buffalo**, where I began my Ph.D. in **Fall 2025**.

My research interests lie in **Smart Health**, **Mobile Computing**, and **Mobile Health**, focusing on bridging the gap between **physiological signals** and **machine learning algorithms** to develop more effective and intelligent healthcare solutions.

I completed my **Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science** from **Tribhuvan University, Nepal** in 2024. During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a **Software Engineer** at *eSewa*, a leading fintech company in Nepal, and also gained experience as a **Technical Writer and Software Engineer** at *Programiz*, an e-learning platform that provides beginner-friendly programming resources and tutorials.

If you have some ideas and would like to collaborate, I would love to get in touch.
